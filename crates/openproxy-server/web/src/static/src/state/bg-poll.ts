// data at mount and after every user mutation (see handlers/*-handlers.ts,
// which call `rerenderCurrentView()`), because a global data poll re-painted
// the DOM under inputs and stole focus. A view that needs live numbers
// subscribes to a state slice in its own mount and patches that node. Live
// logs go through the WebSocket in state/ws.ts.
//
// The tick is setTimeout-recursive, not setInterval: the next tick is
// scheduled in `finally`, after the await settles, so a single call is ever
